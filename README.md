# ap-platformer
2D Platformer game for the Applied Programming class

## Fixed
character fall now displays as a fall.

## Implemented
Full enemy definitions.
Added an enemy framework, still WIP (Work in Progress)

## Currently Working on
Implementing enemys

## Bugs
Not so much a bug, but switching states refreshes the character input. So holding a button that should only be pressed will immediately refresh upon character state changing.
